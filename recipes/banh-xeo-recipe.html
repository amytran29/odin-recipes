    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <h3>Crepe Batter:</h3>
    <ul id="menu">
        <li>1 cup rice flour</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon white sugar</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon ground turmeric</li>
        <li>1 cup coconut milk</li>
        <li>1/2 cup water</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Filling</h3>
    <ul id="menu">
        <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil, divided, or as needed</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons minced shallot</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced, or more to taste</li>
        <li>¾ pound fresh shrimp, peeled and deveined</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons fish sauce, or more to taste</li>
        <li>salt to taste</li>
        <li>1 pound mung bean sprouts</li>
        <li>4 lettuce leaves, or as needed</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Direction</h3>
    <ol id="direction">
        <li>Make the crêpe batter: Mix rice flour, sugar, salt, and turmeric together in a large bowl. Beat in coconut milk until thick. Slowly beat in water until it reaches the consistency of a thin crêpe batter.</li><br>
        <li>Make the filling: Heat 1 1/2 tablespoon oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add shallot and garlic; cook and stir until fragrant but not browned, 1 to 2 minutes. Add shrimp; sauté until cooked through and opaque, 3 to 4 minutes. Season with fish sauce and salt. Transfer filling to a bowl.</li><br>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 200 degrees F (95 degrees C).</li><br>
        <li>Wipe out the skillet and reheat over medium heat. Add remaining 1/2 tablespoon oil. Stir crêpe batter and pour 1/2 cup into the hot skillet, swirling to coat the bottom. Lay 3 or 4 cooked shrimp on the bottom half of the crêpe. Top with a small handful of bean sprouts. Cook until batter looks set and edges start to brown, about 1 minute. Fold crêpe over and slide onto an oven-safe plate.</li><br>
        <li>Place crêpe in the preheated oven to keep warm. Repeat with remaining batter, shrimp, and bean sprouts</li><br>
        <li>Serve crêpes with lettuce leaves. Break off pieces of crêpe and roll them up in lettuce to eat.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Variations</h3>
    <p><b>Vegetarian banh xeo:</b> Substitute shredded, fried tofu for the shrimp to make a vegetarian version. Add a variety of mushrooms to give it a meaty flavor. Use soy sauce instead of fish sauce.</p>
    <p><b>Banh xeo with eggs:</b> Beat 4 to 5 eggs and pour a little over each crêpe after you add the batter to the skillet, but before you add the fillings. Cover the pan for about a minute to let the egg set, then continue with the filling ingredients.</p><br>
